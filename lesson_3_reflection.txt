When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  The ideal situation is when we work with a group of people on some project and other
  people should be able to see my code. Also, when i am working from two different
  locations/machines.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  With manual pulling, the control is with me in regards to any code changes. I might want
  to check whether the code will not break the application and if it does, then the buggy 
  code needs to be fixed so that i can pull it.
