When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  The ideal situation is when we work with a group of people on some project and other
  people should be able to see my code. Also, when i am working from two different
  locations/machines.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  With manual pulling, the control is with me in regards to any code changes. I might want
  to check whether the code will not break the application and if it does, then the buggy 
  code needs to be fixed so that i can pull it.
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
   Branches add new changes in the same repository. Forks and clones copy any repository
   into a new location. Forks works between GitHub accounts only. Clone works on any Git
   repository and make a copy to any location where the user has access.
   
   When collaborating in a team, branching will be a good choice of adding new changes and
   maintaining reference to each changes as in versions. If i want to work on any repository
   and make my changes locally, then i will clone it to my local system. If i want to make 
   any changes (my own changes) to a repository publically, I use fork.
