What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    
    When we initialize a repository, it creates a new sub directory named 
    .git which contains all the necessary repository files.
    
    We need to initialize if we want to track the versioning of the files 
    in that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
    
    Working directory is an ongoing work-in-progress directory. Developers keep 
    making changes. Once, we know there will be no changes to some file, it can
    be committed. But, there need to be an intermediate server to commit the files
    and there should be a possibility to anticipate any unforeseen errors that
    might occur during commit.
    
    This intermediate server is named as Staging directory and it is very helpful.
