What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    
    When we initialize a repository, it creates a new sub directory named 
    .git which contains all the necessary repository files.
    
    We need to initialize if we want to track the versioning of the files 
    in that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
    
    Working directory is an ongoing work-in-progress directory. Developers keep 
    making changes. Once, we know there will be no changes to some file, it can
    be committed. But, there need to be an intermediate server to commit the files
    and there should be a possibility to anticipate any unforeseen errors that
    might occur during commit.
    
    This intermediate server is named as Staging directory and it is very helpful.
    
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
    
    As the purpose of the staging area to store the files which are to be committed.
    We can check the staging area and the working directory and make sure that 
    there will be one logical change per each commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?
 
    Branches would be helpful Whenever we work on a different piece of work like 
    something different. When working on some experimental features, if we branch 
    it and make the changes, it will help us to check the newer version with the 
    previous version, so that our original version stays intact. Branches help in 
    identifying what updates are there in each version of the file.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    Diagrams allow us to see where the branches broke off from the master so you
    can see how much the branch has changed and what changes have been made to master
    that need to added in.
